### The Mifos Stack provides API-driven core banking infrastructure in the cloud.

Apache Fineract (https://github.com/apache/fineract/) is the back-end core banking platform originated by the Mifos Initiative. Mifos X acts as the reference web and mobile apps for staff and customers providing an out of the box ready-to-deploy solution on top of Apache Fineract along with reporting, payments orchestration and other ancillary solutions. 

More than 20 million customers are reached by 400+ institutions using the Mifos and Fineract APIs. 

The back-end has the customer management, wallet/account management, loan and deposit management, general ledger, and reporting services to provide a full range of digital financial services. These back-end services are exposed through a RESTful API allowing others to rapidly build new applications to serve the poor. This multi-tenant architecture is lightweight and ready for the cloud providing the extensibility and scalability for growth.
